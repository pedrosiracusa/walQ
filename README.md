# walQ
An extremely simple questionnaire-based (a.k.a. rule-based) chatbot, built using pure Python.
This package has no dependencies, although we provide a set of examples built on top of Flask.
Questionnaires are specified in Python scripts, and provide the basis for the conversation, taking advantage of the high expressivity of the language.
